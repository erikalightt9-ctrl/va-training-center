**Word Building Blocks:**
- **Root words** — the core meaning (cardi = heart, derm = skin, hepat = liver, neur = nerve, gastr = stomach, pulmon = lung)
- **Prefixes** — modify the root (brady = slow, tachy = fast, hyper = above normal, hypo = below normal, pre = before, post = after)
- **Suffixes** — indicate condition or procedure (-itis = inflammation, -ectomy = removal, -ology = study of, -algia = pain)

**Body Systems to Know:**
Cardiovascular (heart), Respiratory (lungs), Gastrointestinal (digestive), Musculoskeletal (bones/muscles), Neurological (brain/nerves), Endocrine (hormones), Integumentary (skin), Urinary (kidneys/bladder)

**Essential Abbreviations:**
- BP = Blood Pressure, HR = Heart Rate, Rx = Prescription, Dx = Diagnosis, Tx = Treatment
- SOAP = Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan
- PRN = As needed, BID = Twice daily, STAT = Immediately
- CBC = Complete Blood Count, NPO = Nothing by mouth

**Practice:** Tachycardia = tachy (fast) + card (heart) + ia (condition) = rapid heart rate. Master these building blocks to quickly understand any medical term.`,

**The Three HIPAA Rules:**
1. **Privacy Rule** — Controls how PHI is used and disclosed; only share for Treatment, Payment, or Healthcare Operations; apply the "Minimum Necessary" standard
2. **Security Rule** — Protects electronic PHI through administrative, physical, and technical safeguards (encryption, access controls, audit trails)
3. **Breach Notification Rule** — Requires notifying affected individuals within 60 days if PHI is compromised

**Violation Penalties:** Range from $100 per violation (unaware) up to $50,000+ per violation (willful neglect), with possible criminal penalties up to 10 years imprisonment.

**Best Practices for Remote MVAs:**
- Use a dedicated workspace — no shared family computers
- Always connect through a VPN with two-factor authentication enabled
- Use encrypted email for any communication containing PHI
- Lock your screen whenever you step away, even briefly
- Never discuss patient information on social media or personal messaging apps
- Sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with every client
- When in doubt, don't share — always verify authorization first`,

- **athenahealth** — popular with small-to-mid-sized practices; cloud-based
- **NextGen Healthcare** — strong for specialty and ambulatory care
- **Cerner (Oracle Health)** — large hospital systems and government/VA hospitals
- **DrChrono** — mobile-first, great for smaller practices

**Key EHR Functions for MVAs:**
- **Patient Registration** — Enter demographics, verify insurance, update profiles, attach documents
- **Scheduling** — Book appointments by provider and visit type, manage templates, send reminders, handle cancellations
- **Clinical Documentation** — Enter clinical notes, update medication and allergy lists, document vital signs, manage referrals
- **Billing Integration** — Attach ICD-10 diagnosis codes, verify CPT procedure codes, flag incomplete documentation

**Learning Tips:**
- Most vendors offer free online training and certifications
- Request demo/sandbox access to practice without live patient data
- Learn keyboard shortcuts — they save enormous time in daily workflows
- Focus on the workflows most relevant to your assigned role first`,

      title: "Patient Scheduling and Practice Management",
      content: `Efficient scheduling is the lifeline of any medical practice. Poor scheduling leads to no-shows, provider burnout, and revenue loss.

**Appointment Types:**
- New Patient Visit (30-60 min) — comprehensive history and intake
- Established Patient Visit (15-20 min) — follow-up or problem-focused
- Annual Physical / Wellness Exam (30-45 min) — preventive care
- Telehealth Visit — virtual appointment via video platform
- Urgent / Same-Day — reserved slots for acute concerns

**Scheduling Best Practices:**
- Create provider-specific templates with blocked time for lunch and admin tasks
- Reserve urgent slots for same-day requests
- Send reminders 48 and 24 hours before appointments to reduce no-shows
- Maintain a waitlist to fill cancelled slots quickly

**Practice Management Software:** Kareo, AdvancedMD, Practice Fusion, Greenway Health — these handle the business side including billing and scheduling.

**Daily Scheduler Workflow:**
1. Review today's schedule for gaps or overbooking
2. Process overnight appointment requests from patient portal and voicemail
3. Confirm tomorrow's appointments via text or call
4. Handle incoming scheduling calls and online requests
5. Update patient insurance information as needed
6. Send end-of-day summary to provider(s)

**Communication Tips:** Always verify patient identity before discussing information, speak clearly, offer multiple appointment options, and document all communication in the patient's chart.`,

      title: "Insurance Verification and Prior Authorization",
      content: `Insurance verification and prior authorization directly protect the practice's revenue. These are core competencies that make MVAs invaluable.

**Insurance Verification Steps:**
1. **Eligibility** — Confirm active coverage, check effective dates, verify provider is in-network, confirm member ID and group number
2. **Benefits** — Check deductible status, copay/coinsurance amounts, referral requirements, and out-of-pocket maximum

**Common US Insurance Types:**
- HMO — requires PCP referral for specialists, in-network only
- PPO — more flexibility, higher cost for out-of-network
- Medicare — federal insurance for 65+ and disabled (Parts A, B, C, D)
- Medicaid — state-managed insurance for low-income individuals
- TRICARE — military and veteran insurance

**Prior Authorization Process:**
1. Check if the service requires pre-approval from the insurance company
2. Gather clinical documentation (physician notes, labs, imaging)
3. Submit the request via phone, fax, or online portal
4. Track the request and follow up if not approved within expected timeframe
5. Document the authorization number, approved dates, and limitations
6. Communicate the result to scheduling team and patient

**Key Tools:** Availity (multi-payer portal), Waystar (revenue cycle management), individual payer portals (UHC, Aetna, Cigna, Blue Cross), and the practice's built-in EHR eligibility features.

**Tips:** Verify insurance at least 48 hours before appointments, log all authorization numbers and expiration dates, and document every call with date, time, rep name, and reference number.`,

      title: "Medical Billing and Coding Fundamentals",
      content: `Medical billing is submitting and following up on claims with insurance companies to receive payment for services provided.

**The Billing Cycle:**
Patient registration → Encounter → Medical coding → Charge entry → Claim submission → Payment posting → Denial management → Patient billing

**Key Code Systems:**
- **ICD-10** (Diagnosis codes) — describes WHY the patient was seen (e.g., J06.9 = Acute upper respiratory infection). Over 70,000 codes available.
- **CPT** (Procedure codes) — describes WHAT was done. Common: 99213 = established patient visit, 99203 = new patient visit.
- **HCPCS** — for supplies and equipment not covered by CPT (e.g., J3420 = Vitamin B-12 injection)

**Reading an EOB (Explanation of Benefits):**
Shows services billed, allowed amount, insurance payment, and patient responsibility (copay, deductible, coinsurance).

**Common Denial Reasons:**
- Patient not eligible on date of service
- Service requires prior authorization not obtained
- Incorrect or missing diagnosis/procedure codes
- Out-of-network provider or duplicate claim

**Your Role as an MVA:**
You are NOT expected to be a certified coder. You WILL assist with charge entry, claim scrubbing, denial follow-up, and payment posting. Understanding coding basics helps you communicate effectively with the billing team. Always escalate complex coding questions to a certified coder or provider.`,

- Never provide medical advice — redirect clinical questions to nursing staff
- Respond to patient portal messages within 24 hours using templates for common requests

**Outbound Communication:**
- Automated appointment reminders 48 hours before via text/email
- Post-procedure check-in calls and lab result notifications (per provider instruction — never interpret results)

**Handling Difficult Situations:**
- Listen without interrupting, acknowledge their feelings, apologize for inconvenience (not care), offer a solution, escalate if needed
- For emergencies (chest pain, difficulty breathing, suicidal thoughts): instruct patient to call 911 immediately and notify the provider

**HIPAA in Communication:**
- Never leave detailed voicemails with medical information
- Never email PHI without encryption
- A patient's spouse or family does NOT automatically have access — follow authorization forms

**What is a CMA?**
A Comparative Market Analysis estimates a property's market value by comparing it to similar recently sold properties ("comps"). It is NOT an appraisal.

**Steps to Create a CMA:**
1. **Identify the subject property** — address, beds/baths, sq ft, lot size, year built, condition, upgrades
2. **Find comparable sales** — within 0.5–1 mile, sold in last 3–6 months, similar size (within 10–20%), same neighborhood/school district, aim for 3–5 comps
3. **Analyze and adjust** — price per sq ft, adjust for differences (extra bedroom, pool, updated kitchen), factor in market conditions
4. **Present a price range** — narrow range shows confidence (e.g., $395,000–$415,000)

**Key Market Metrics:**
- Median Sale Price, Average Days on Market, List-to-Sale Price Ratio
- Months of Inventory: < 3 months = Seller's market, 3–6 = Balanced, > 6 = Buyer's market

**Research Tools:** MLS (primary source), Zillow, Redfin, Realtor.com, Google Maps/Street View, GreatSchools.org

**CMA Presentation:** Create a branded PDF with subject property summary, comparable sales grid, adjustments, recommended price range, market conditions, and the agent's marketing plan. Canva has excellent CMA templates.`,

**Showing Coordination:**
- Respond to showing requests within 30 minutes
- Confirm with the seller if the property is occupied
- Provide instructions: lockbox code, parking, pets, alarm codes
- Space overlapping requests 30–60 minutes apart

**Showing Feedback Collection:**
Send feedback requests to buyer's agents within 24 hours asking about client interest, price expectations, and concerns. Compile weekly feedback reports for the seller.

**Showing Platforms:** ShowingTime (Zillow), Showing Assist, Centralized Showing Service

**Open House Planning:**
*Pre-Event:* Create flyers and social media posts, post on MLS, create Facebook event, send email to agent's database, prepare sign-in sheets (paper or digital via Spacio)

*Day-Of:* Confirm agent has all materials, ensure property is show-ready, post "Open House Today" on social media

*Post-Event (within 24 hours):* Enter all contacts into CRM, send personalized follow-up texts/emails, tag contacts by interest level, schedule follow-up tasks for agent, report attendance to seller

**Virtual Open Houses:** Use Facebook Live or Instagram Live for property walkthroughs, engage with live comments, and record for on-demand viewing.`,

      content: `Bookkeeping is the backbone of every successful business. As a Bookkeeping VA, you'll manage the financial health of US-based businesses — a role that is highly valued and well-compensated.

**Bookkeeping vs. Accounting:**
- **Bookkeeping** — recording transactions, categorizing expenses, reconciling accounts, invoicing
- **Accounting** — analyzing data, preparing financial statements, tax planning, audits

**Your Professional Boundaries:**
You CAN record transactions, categorize expenses, reconcile accounts, generate reports, manage invoices, and process payroll data. You CANNOT file tax returns, provide tax advice, perform audits, or sign financial statements (that requires a CPA).

**The Fundamental Accounting Equation:** Assets = Liabilities + Equity

**The Five Account Types:**
1. **Assets** — what the business owns (cash, accounts receivable, equipment)
2. **Liabilities** — what the business owes (loans, accounts payable, credit cards)
3. **Equity** — owner's stake (investment, retained earnings)
4. **Revenue** — income from business activities
5. **Expenses** — costs of running the business

**Cash vs. Accrual Accounting:**
- **Cash Basis** — record when money is received/paid (simpler, used by small businesses)
- **Accrual Basis** — record when earned/incurred (more accurate, required by GAAP for larger businesses)

This course will give you the skills to confidently manage books for US businesses using industry-standard tools and practices.`,

      content: `Every transaction in double-entry bookkeeping is recorded in at least TWO accounts — a debit and a credit. This system is self-balancing and error-detecting.

**Debit and Credit Rules:**
- Assets and Expenses: Debit increases, Credit decreases
- Liabilities, Equity, and Revenue: Credit increases, Debit decreases
- Memory aid "DEA-LER": Debits increase Expenses and Assets; Credits increase Liabilities, Equity, and Revenue

**Transaction Examples:**
- Receive $5,000 payment: Debit Cash +$5,000 / Credit Accounts Receivable -$5,000
- Pay $1,200 rent: Debit Rent Expense +$1,200 / Credit Cash -$1,200
- Buy $3,000 equipment on credit: Debit Equipment +$3,000 / Credit Accounts Payable +$3,000

**Chart of Accounts Structure:**
- 1000s: Assets (Checking, Savings, A/R, Equipment)
- 2000s: Liabilities (A/P, Credit Cards, Loans)
- 3000s: Equity (Owner's Equity, Retained Earnings)
- 4000s: Revenue (Service Revenue, Product Sales)
- 5000s: Cost of Goods Sold
- 6000s: Expenses (Rent, Utilities, Supplies, Payroll)

**The Accounting Cycle:**
Analyze transactions → Record journal entries → Post to general ledger → Prepare trial balance → Make adjusting entries → Prepare financial statements → Close temporary accounts → Start next period

In QuickBooks, many of these steps are automated — but understanding them helps you troubleshoot and catch errors.`,

      title: "QuickBooks Online Setup and Navigation",
      content: `QuickBooks Online (QBO) is the most widely used bookkeeping software for US small businesses. Over 80% of US small businesses use some version of QuickBooks.

**QBO Plans:** Simple Start (1 user), Essentials (3 users, bill management), Plus (5 users, inventory, budgeting), Advanced (25 users, custom roles). Most VAs work with Plus or Essentials.

**Initial Company Setup:**
1. **Company Info** — legal name, business type (LLC, S-Corp, etc.), EIN, fiscal year, accounting method
2. **Chart of Accounts** — review defaults, add industry-specific accounts, create sub-accounts for detailed tracking
3. **Bank Connections** — connect bank and credit card accounts via automatic feeds, set up bank rules for auto-categorization
4. **Vendors and Customers** — import lists with payment terms, set defaults (Net 15, Net 30, Due on Receipt)

**Key QBO Navigation:**
- Dashboard — overview of income, expenses, bank balances
- Banking — bank feed transactions, rules, reconciliation
- Sales — invoices, estimates, customers
- Expenses — bills, vendors, purchase orders
- Reports — 65+ built-in financial reports

**Bank Rules (Automation):** Set rules to auto-categorize recurring transactions (e.g., "ADOBE" → Software Subscriptions). Rules save 5–10 hours per month.

**Pro Tips:** Reconcile monthly, review uncategorized transactions weekly, use Classes to track profitability by department, and set up recurring transactions for monthly bills.`,

      title: "Accounts Payable — Managing Bills and Vendor Payments",
      content: `Accounts Payable (A/P) represents money the business owes to vendors. Proper management ensures good vendor relationships and healthy cash flow.

**The A/P Cycle:**
1. **Receive** — Verify the bill is legitimate, check for duplicates (the #1 A/P error)
2. **Enter in QBO** — Select vendor, enter dates and amounts, code to correct expense account, attach original PDF
3. **Approve** — Route for owner/manager approval, flag unusual expenses
4. **Schedule Payment** — Check terms (Net 15, Net 30), take early payment discounts when available (e.g., 2/10 Net 30)
5. **Process Payment** — Pay via check, ACH, or credit card; record method and reference number
6. **Reconcile** — Monthly, compare vendor statements to your A/P records

**Key A/P Reports:**
- A/P Aging Summary — unpaid bills grouped by due date (Current, 1–30, 31–60, 61–90, 90+ days)
- Vendor Balance Summary — total owed to each vendor

**1099 Vendor Tracking:**
US businesses must issue Form 1099-NEC to non-corporate vendors paid $600+ per year. Flag vendors as "1099 eligible" in QBO, collect W-9 forms, and generate 1099s in January.

**Best Practices:** Enter bills immediately, always attach original PDFs, never pay from a statement alone, and review the A/P Aging report weekly.`,

      content: `Accounts Receivable (A/R) represents money owed TO the business. Getting paid on time is critical for business survival.

**The A/R Cycle:**
1. **Create Invoices** — In QBO: add products/services, set payment terms, customize with logo, send via email
2. **Record Payments** — Match payments to correct invoices, record method and deposit account
3. **Handle Credits/Refunds** — Credit memos reduce balance; refund receipts decrease revenue
4. **Collections Follow-Up** — Day 1 past due: automated reminder → Day 7: personal email → Day 14: phone call → Day 30: formal letter → Day 60+: consider write-off

**Invoice Best Practices:**
Include business name/logo, sequential invoice number, dates, itemized services, subtotal/taxes/total, accepted payment methods, and late payment policy.

**Key A/R Reports:**
- A/R Aging Summary — unpaid invoices by age (the most important A/R report)
- Customer Balance Summary — total owed by each customer

**Handling Bad Debt:**
When a customer truly won't pay: make final collection attempts, create a credit memo coded to "Bad Debt Expense," apply it to the invoice, and document all efforts for tax purposes.

**Tips for Faster Payments:** Send invoices immediately, offer multiple payment methods, consider early payment discounts, use QBO Payments for direct invoice payment, and track your Days Sales Outstanding (DSO).`,

      title: "Bank and Credit Card Reconciliation",
      content: `Bank reconciliation is the most important monthly bookkeeping task. It ensures your books match reality.

**Why Reconcile?**
Catches bank errors, detects fraud, identifies data entry mistakes, ensures financial reports are accurate, and is required for tax preparation.

**The Reconciliation Process in QBO:**
1. **Prepare** — Get the bank statement, verify beginning balance matches prior period's ending balance, enter statement ending balance and date
2. **Match Transactions** — Check off each transaction that appears on both the statement and QBO; work through deposits first, then debits
3. **Identify Discrepancies** — Outstanding checks (not yet cleared), deposits in transit, bank charges, interest income, automatic payments, or data entry errors
4. **Finalize** — Add missing transactions, research unexplained differences; the "Difference" field must show $0.00 before finishing

**Credit Card Reconciliation:** Same process — compare QBO to statement, verify categories, watch for fees and interest charges.

**Red Flags:** Large unexplained differences, recurring monthly discrepancies, negative balances, or transactions you don't recognize (possible fraud).

**Schedule:** Bank accounts monthly (first week of new month), credit cards monthly, PayPal/Stripe monthly if used.

**Key Rules:** Never change the opening balance to force a match — investigate the real cause. Reconcile one month at a time and never skip months.`,

**The Three Core Financial Statements:**

**1. Profit and Loss (Income Statement):**
Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses = Net Income.
Key question: Is the business profitable and which costs are growing?

**2. Balance Sheet:**
Assets = Liabilities + Equity (at a specific point in time).
Shows what the business owns, owes, and is worth. If it doesn't balance, there's an error.

**3. Statement of Cash Flows:**
Operating Activities + Investing Activities + Financing Activities.
A profitable business can still run out of cash — this report reveals the true cash position.

**Additional Important Reports:**
A/R Aging, A/P Aging, General Ledger, Trial Balance, Sales by Customer, Expense by Vendor, Budget vs. Actual

**Generating Reports in QBO:** Navigate to Reports, customize date range and comparison periods, memorize frequently used reports, and schedule auto-email delivery to clients.

**Presenting to Clients:**
Many business owners aren't financial people. Lead with headlines ("Revenue is up 12%"), use charts, compare periods, highlight action items ("Your largest unpaid invoice is $12,000, now 45 days overdue"), and schedule monthly 15–30 minute review calls.`,

**Employee vs. Independent Contractor:**
- **W-2 Employee** — set hours, company tools, employer withholds taxes (income, SS, Medicare), receives benefits, Form W-2
- **1099 Contractor** — sets own hours/tools, NO tax withholding, no benefits, receives Form 1099-NEC if paid $600+
- Misclassification triggers IRS audits with severe penalties

**US Payroll Taxes:**
- *Employee withholdings:* Federal income tax, state income tax (varies by state), Social Security (6.2%), Medicare (1.45%)
- *Employer taxes:* Matching SS (6.2%), matching Medicare (1.45%), FUTA (0.6%), SUTA (varies by state)
- Total FICA: 15.3% split equally between employee and employer

**Common Payroll Schedules:** Weekly (52/year), Bi-weekly (26/year — most common), Semi-monthly (24/year), Monthly (12/year)

**Your Role:** Validate timesheets, submit hours to payroll service, review reports, record journal entries in QBO, reconcile payroll liabilities, track PTO balances, maintain employee records.
